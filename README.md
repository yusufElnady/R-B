The latest version is : game_GDWC

This repository contains "poly wars", a game made by "Yusuf El-Nady", mainly for the GDWC.

poly wars is a single player and a co-op third person shooter, where you can play a solo survival level, where you fight zombies (the green circles), and as you grab more booster cubes (the red, blue, and yellow cubes), the more powerful you become, in terms of faster gun fire, more 
health or more speed, or, you can play against a friend, or with him\her and fight zombies, and at the end, you are directed to the scoring 
screen to see the scores.

Evenmore, you can customize your player, and choose one of he characters, Circle McPi , square wright or his twin rect (get it?),
where each of them has special capalities, such that rect is a machine gunner which shoots quicker but weaker bullets and can block 
zombies that are approaching sideways from damaging him, McPi shoots regular bullets at regular speed, and square which shots very 
powerful bullets that are capable of killing a zombie immediately, yet he tends to take his time. Also, you can choose a color from 
them from a range of colors.

In the future a multiplayer battle royale mode will be added in the near fututre isa

Also, try and run away as fast as you can from the zombies or hide, because if the catch up to you, it'll be hard to free yourself
from them, you can run but you can't hide!
