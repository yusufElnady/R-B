# RGB_game
This repository contains "RGB", a game made by "Yusuf El-Nady", mainly for the GDWC.

RGB is a single player and a co-op third person shooter, where you can play a solo survival level, wher you fight zombies (the green
circles), and as you grab more booster cubes (the yello cubes), the more powerful you become, in terms of faster gun fire, more 
health or more speed, or, you can play along with a friend, and fight zombies, and at the end, you are directed to the scoring 
screen, where you have to press the "show" button to reveal the scores.

Also, try and run away as fast as you can from the zombies or hide, because if the catch up to you, it'll be hard to free yourself
from them, you can run but you can't hide!
